## Major depressive disorde; Rs-fMRI;  
## Code for APO-GCN model
Diagnosis of major depressive disorder using a novel interpretable GCN model based on resting state fMRI 
An adaptive propagation operator graph convolutional network

## Overview
The propagation operator of the APO-GCN, incorporating trainable channel weighting factors (Ï‰), substantially augments the adaptability of the model.

## Code Description
the main architecture of APO-GCN lies in the `models.py`. The `APO-GCN1 and APO-GCN2.py` are the main backbone, while the rest necessary modules are distributed into different files based on their own functions, i.e., `VariableOperator.py`, `Variable_chevconv.py`. Please refer to each file to acquire more implementation details.
